# Thinking in React:

# The "Thinking in React" Process:

# 1. Break the desired UI into components and establish the component tree. This also include thinking about reuseability and composibility of components.

# 2. Build a static version in React without any state and interactivity.

# 3. Think about state:

# ğŸ‘‰ When to use state

# ğŸ‘‰ Types of state: local vs global

# ğŸ‘‰ Where to place each piece of state

# 4. Establish data flow:

# ğŸ‘‰ One-way data flow

# ğŸ‘‰ Child-to-parent communication

# ğŸ‘‰ Accessing global state

# Step 3 and 4 are called state management.

# When you know how to "Think In React", you will be able to answer:

# ğŸ¤” How to break up UI Design into components?

# ğŸ¤” How to make some components reusable?

# ğŸ¤” How to assemble UI from reusable components?

# ğŸ¤” What pieces of state do I need for interactivity?

# ğŸ¤” Where to place state? (What component should "own" each piece of state?)

# ğŸ¤” What types of state can or should I use?

# ğŸ¤” How to make data flow through app?
